# eCHO

With a little bit of imagination, eCHO stands for "eBPF & Cilium Office Hours". Inspired by [TGIK](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tgik) this is a new livestream where we'll discuss all things related to the Cilium project and the broader world of eBPF. 

We'd love your questions during the show, either on YouTube chat or in the #eCHO channel in [Cilium Slack](https://cilium.herokuapp.com).
