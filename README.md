# eCHO

With a little bit of imagination, eCHO stands for "eBPF & Cilium Office Hours". Inspired by [TGIK](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tgik) this is a new livestream where we'll discuss all things related to the Cilium project and the broader world of eBPF. 

 - Episode #1 "Intro to Cilium" - 6am PT, 9am ET, 2pm UK, 3pm Central Europe - Friday 16th April 2021
 - Episode #2, topic TBD - 11am PT, 2pm ET, 7pm UK, 8pm Central Europe - Friday 23rd April 2021

We'd love your questions during the show, either on YouTube chat or in the #eCHO channel in [Cilium Slack](https://cilium.herokuapp.com).
